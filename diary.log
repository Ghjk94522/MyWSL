    try the first question of the kickstart round 1 so many many times and pass eventually
    the reason of the endless RE is I don't check the index of the vector.
    (I use a independent var to index the vector in a loop)

    In the advanced OJ test, I forget to check if the mission is legle in the normal truck
    which has a distance limit, and I don't find it until I notice the chat in the QQ group.
    Should be remembered !!!

    And I just make a mistake that I use a loop :
        for(int i = 0; i < 100; i *= 2){..}
    So stupid am I, this is a forever loop!!!
