Build a priority queue queEdge of edges in G, prioritized by the edge weights;
Initialize a disjoint set of nodes of G, with each node in its own set;
Initialize the minimum spanning tree MST to {};
while queEdge != empty do:
    vw := queEdge.EXTRACT_MIN();
    if FIND(v) != FIND(w) then:
        MST := MST or {vw};
        if MST.size = n-1 then:
            return;
        UNION(v, w);
