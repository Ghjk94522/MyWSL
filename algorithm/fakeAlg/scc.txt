def scc(G):
    Initiate the empty stack nodeStack;
    Perform DFS on G. In the postorder processing of each vertex v, insert the statement "nodeStack.push(v)"
    Compute the transpose graph G_T of G;
    Color all nodes WHITE;
    while nodeStack != empty do:
        v := nodeStack.pop();
        Conduct DFS from v on G_T;
