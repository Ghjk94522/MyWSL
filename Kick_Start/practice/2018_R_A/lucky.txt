Problem B :
In this lucky dip, there is a bag with N items. The i-th item in the bag has value V_i.
You will put your hand into the bag and draw one item at random; all items in the bag has an equal
probability of being chosen.
You may only redip a maximum of K times.

Play optimally to maximize the value of the item you will end the game with, what's the 
expected value of that item?
